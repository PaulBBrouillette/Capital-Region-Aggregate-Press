                Capital Region Aggregate Press (C.R.A.P.) is your most trusted and only source for hard-hitting news about New York's glorious Capital Region. For those unfamiliar, the Capital Region consists of the following counties:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Albany</li>
                <li>Columbia</li>
                <li>Fulton</li>
                <li>Greene</li>
                <li>Montgomery</li>
                <li>Rensselaer</li>
                <li>Saratoga</li>
                <li>Schenectady</li>
                <li>Schoharie</li>
                <li>Washington</li>
                <li>and Warren, unfortunately</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

                We're a scrappy team of journalists with far too much free time. In fact, we're so short-staffed that one of our reporters also had to code this very website. What we lack in manpower, we make up for in our undying devotion to the Capital Regionâ€”and in our ability to churn out quality articles.*
            </p>

                From potholes that swallow entire neighborhoods, to state government blunders, to the kind of politics that only Albany could produce, we cover it all. Sometimes the Capital Region is amazing. Sometimes it's a mess. Either way, we're here to document it.
